# Troubleshooting

## Development Scenarios

Local:
Configure and run a local Docker machine Maana system and custom services (i.e., a "deployment").

Maana R&D Activities:
Remote: Mixed Environments - A Maana deployment is hosted elsewhere (e.g., Azure), developing a service locally.

Not supported in Version 3.0?

If local and developing an a (locally) deployed service, then "docker stop" it and run/debug it manually.
