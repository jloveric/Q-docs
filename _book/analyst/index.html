<h3 id="what-is-maana">What is Maana</h3>
<p>In 2013 Maana invented <a href="../glossary.html#a" class="glossary-term" title="">a</a> new way to represent industrial knowledge mathematically, using the Maana Patented Computational <a href="../glossary.html#knowledge-graph" class="glossary-term" title="All the data associated with a Tenant.  Combined with Maana&#x2019;s proprietary AI algorithms, the knowledge graph expedites knowledge extraction from data silos, to reveal their relationships in the context of optimizing operations and decision flows.">Knowledge Graph</a>&#x2122;. This unique technology enables industrial companies to encode human expertise and data from across silos into digital knowledge to help employees make better and faster decisions. The Maana Computational <a href="../glossary.html#knowledge-graph" class="glossary-term" title="All the data associated with a Tenant.  Combined with Maana&#x2019;s proprietary AI algorithms, the knowledge graph expedites knowledge extraction from data silos, to reveal their relationships in the context of optimizing operations and decision flows.">Knowledge Graph</a>&#x2122; is <a href="../glossary.html#a" class="glossary-term" title="">a</a> network of models that optimize specific operations and decisions flows by providing recommendations through AI-Driven Applications into those operations. This unique technology eliminates the need to move data and enables creation of thousands of models at scale, through the re-usability of models across the enterprise.</p>

<h3 id="why-maana">Why Maana</h3>
<p>The core of the Maana Knowledge Platform&#x2122; is its patented Computational <a href="../glossary.html#knowledge-graph" class="glossary-term" title="All the data associated with a Tenant.  Combined with Maana&#x2019;s proprietary AI algorithms, the knowledge graph expedites knowledge extraction from data silos, to reveal their relationships in the context of optimizing operations and decision flows.">Knowledge Graph</a>&#x2122;. The Maana <a href="../glossary.html#knowledge-graph" class="glossary-term" title="All the data associated with a Tenant.  Combined with Maana&#x2019;s proprietary AI algorithms, the knowledge graph expedites knowledge extraction from data silos, to reveal their relationships in the context of optimizing operations and decision flows.">Knowledge Graph</a> is unique in several ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Unlike traditional &#x201C;semantic&#x201D; systems, the <a href="../glossary.html#knowledge-graph" class="glossary-term" title="All the data associated with a Tenant.  Combined with Maana&#x2019;s proprietary AI algorithms, the knowledge graph expedites knowledge extraction from data silos, to reveal their relationships in the context of optimizing operations and decision flows.">Knowledge Graph</a> does not rely exclusively on ontologies and description logics. Instead, the <a href="../glossary.html#knowledge-graph" class="glossary-term" title="All the data associated with a Tenant.  Combined with Maana&#x2019;s proprietary AI algorithms, the knowledge graph expedites knowledge extraction from data silos, to reveal their relationships in the context of optimizing operations and decision flows.">Knowledge Graph</a> separates the structure of data from the content itself. This separation enables <a href="../glossary.html#a" class="glossary-term" title="">a</a> fluidity of modeling, allowing data from any source and in any format to be seamlessly integrated, modeled, searched, analyzed, operationalized and re-purposed.</li>
<li>The data remains at the source and only the most relevant data in the context of what is being optimized is indexed and brought into the graph.</li>
<li>Each resulting <a href="../glossary.html#model" class="glossary-term" title="Software that encodes mathematical relationships among, for example,(i) a set or sets of data(aka a &#x201C;data model&#x201D;), (ii) processes (aka a &#x201C;process model&#x201D;), (iii) domain knowledge (aka a &#x201C;domain or knowledge model&#x201D;), (iv) outcomes (aka a &#x201C;predictive model&#x201D;), and (v) matter and motion (aka, a &#x201C;physics model&#x201D;) that is developed using the Maana Knowledge Platform and addresses a Use Case when operating on and in connection with the Maana Knowledge Platform.">model</a> is <a href="../glossary.html#a" class="glossary-term" title="">a</a> unique combination of three key components &#x2013; subject matter expertise, relevant data from silos, and the right algorithm &#x2013; all of which are instrumental in optimizing assets and decision flows.</li>
<li>The Maana Computational <a href="../glossary.html#knowledge-graph" class="glossary-term" title="All the data associated with a Tenant.  Combined with Maana&#x2019;s proprietary AI algorithms, the knowledge graph expedites knowledge extraction from data silos, to reveal their relationships in the context of optimizing operations and decision flows.">Knowledge Graph</a> is also dynamic. Nodes, which represent concepts in Maana&#x2019;<a href="../glossary.html#s" class="glossary-term" title="">s</a> graph are not static containers; they are computational vessels that allow for algorithms to be stored and executed. These algorithms could be as simple as pulling in new data from an external source, to as complicated as classification of documents through <a href="../glossary.html#machine-learning" class="glossary-term" title="Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence in the field of computer science that often uses statistical techniques to give computers the ability to &quot;learn&quot; with data, without being explicitly programmed.">machine learning</a>. As data is updated in real-time at the source, so are the nodes and the computational models that act on that data. This allows for far more complex relationships to be modeled, and facilitates the ability of the graph to understand the connections between concepts, rather than just strings in data. Ultimately this is used for optimizing decisions or operations.</li>
<li>Reusable Models</li>
</ol>
<p>The flexibility of the Maana <a href="../glossary.html#knowledge-graph" class="glossary-term" title="All the data associated with a Tenant.  Combined with Maana&#x2019;s proprietary AI algorithms, the knowledge graph expedites knowledge extraction from data silos, to reveal their relationships in the context of optimizing operations and decision flows.">Knowledge Graph</a> enables groups across the organization to leverage and build-upon models created by other groups, dramatically accelerating the speed at which models are created throughout the organization. These models are dynamic, and once operationalized into line-of-business applications, they learn and adapt based on the user&#x2019;<a href="../glossary.html#s" class="glossary-term" title="">s</a> behaviors and provide continuous intelligence for day-to-day operations.</p>
